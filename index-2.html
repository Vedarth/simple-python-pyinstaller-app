<p>This repository is for the
<a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-python-app-with-pyinstaller/">Build a Python app with PyInstaller</a>
tutorial in the <a href="https://jenkins.io/doc/">Jenkins User Documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The repository contains a simple Python application which is a command line tool "add2vals" that outputs the addition of two values. If at least one of the
values is a string, "add2vals" treats both values as a string and instead
concatenates the values. The "add2" function in the "calc" library (which
"add2vals" imports) is accompanied by a set of unit tests. These are tested with pytest to check that this function works as expected and the results are saved
to a JUnit XML report.</p>
<p>The delivery of the "add2vals" tool through PyInstaller converts this tool into
a standalone executable file for Linux, which you can download through Jenkins
and execute at the command line on Linux machines without Python.</p>
<p>The <code>jenkins</code> directory contains an example of the <code>Jenkinsfile</code> (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial.</p>
